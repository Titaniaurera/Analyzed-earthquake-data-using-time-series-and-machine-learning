🌍 **Analyzed Earthquake Data Using Time Series and Machine Learning** 🔍📊  

In this project, my team (**Hendra Cahyono, Joevita, and myself**) analyzed earthquake data using **time series analysis** and **machine learning** to enhance early warning systems for natural disasters.  

**🛠️ Key Steps:**  
✅ **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared geospatial datasets for further analysis 📌  
✅ **Resampling Data:** Improved alert class distribution from **3.69% to 100%** to enhance model accuracy ⚡  
✅ **Machine Learning Model:** Implemented **Random Forest Regressor**, achieving **94% accuracy** in earthquake prediction 🤖  
✅ **Geospatial Analytics:** Integrated spatial analysis to improve disaster risk understanding and support strategic decision-making 📍  

💡 **Results & Impact:**  
🔹 The prediction model supports decision-making for disaster mitigation 🔹  
🔹 Geospatial analysis enhances **Strategic System Management** in disaster planning 🔹  
🔹 Business Intelligence techniques were applied to visualize earthquake trends and risk patterns in real-time 🔹  

🚀 **This project aims to leverage data-driven approaches for disaster mitigation, improve preparedness, and utilize technology for natural hazard risk management.** 🌏✨
